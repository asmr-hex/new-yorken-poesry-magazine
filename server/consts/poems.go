                        DEATH! 
                        Plop. 
The barges down in the river flop. 
                        Flop, plop, 
            Above,  beneath. 
From the slimy branches the grey drips drop, 
As they scraggle black on the thin grey sky, 
Where the black cloud rack-hackles drizzle and fly 
To the oozy waters, that lounge and flop 
On the black scrag piles, where the loose cords plop. 
As the raw wind whines in the thin tree-top.
                        Plop, plop. 
            And scudding by 
The boatmen call out hoy ! and hey ! 
And all is running in water and sky, 
            And my head shrieks—“Stop,” 
            And my heart shrieks—“Die.” 
            *          *          *          *          * 
My thought is running our of my head ; 
My love is running out of my heart ; 
My soul runs after, and leaves me as dead, 
For my life runs after to catch them—and fled 
They are all every one !—and I stand, and start, 
All the water that oozes up, plop and plop, 
On the barges that flop 
                                    And dizzy me dead. 
I might reel and drop. 
                                    Plop. 
                                    Dead. 
And the shrill wind whines in the thin tree-top. 
                       Flop, plop. 
                    *          *          *          *          * 
A curse on him. 
                                    Ugh ! yet I knew—I knew— 
If a woman is false can a friend be true? 
It was only a lie from beginning to end— 
                        My Devil—my “Friend” 
I had trusted the whole of my living to ! 
                        Ugh ! and I knew ! 
                                    Ugh ! 
                        So what do I care, 
            And my head is as empty as air— 
                        I can do, 
                        I can dare, 
            (Plop, plop, 
            The barges flop 
            Drip, drop.) 
                        I can dare, I can dare ! 
And let myself all run away with my head, 
And stop. 
                        Drop 
                        Dead. 
                        Plop, flop. 
                                    Plop.
